DEF CON 22 - Metacortex and Grifter - Touring the Darkside of the Internet. An Introduction to Tor


The speakers discuss the darknet and introduce it by describing it as a place on the internet that people access to find questionable things, such as hitmen, drugs, and various other nefarious items. They show the audience how to use and connect Tor, which allows a user to search on the internet anonymously and uses https encryption on everything that is searched. They advise to only visit addresses in Tor that are “.onion” addresses, and they show some recommended sites to go to in Tor. One of the speaker shows the audience how to get onto Silk Road to see a marketplace of illegal things that can be purchased like pirated movies, electronics, drugs, people’s SSNs and credit card numbers, etc. It was interesting to see the cost listed of buying someone’s identity and what other people think a person’s identity is worth. The prices were “$1”, which was pretty sad. There were also fake passports available to purchase. All in all a troubling view into how the internet has forged a new pathway to break the law.
